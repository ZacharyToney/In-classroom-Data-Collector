# In-classroom-Data-Collector
# Summary
Gary wants a tool to help him collect data about students' movements in the class. This tool will be used by Gary and let him customize lots of stuff in a classroom. The classroom should be modeled inside the tool. Most of the items in a classroom should be modelable in the tool, e.g. chairs, seats, tables etc. Gary will place students somewhere in the classroom with some identifiable properties about them (like hair color, clothes etc.). Then, client will be able to move each student over time. Each movement will be saved and an appropriate report will be generated at the end in a meaningful format.
